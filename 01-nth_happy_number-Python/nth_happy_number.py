# Write the function nthHappyNumber(n) which takes a non-negative integer

# assert(nthHappyNumber(1) == 7)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(2) == 10)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(3) == 13)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(4) == 19)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(5) == 23)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(6) == 28)
# assert(nthHappyNumber(7) == 31)
